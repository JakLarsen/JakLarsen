ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name's Jake, and I'm currently working on my Skydiving Coach license and building out my first demo app -Emotify-

Emotify utilizes Neural-Navigation, allowing users to navigate a Spotify-inspired audio app using their BRAINWAVES.
 - Using an Emotiv Insight for realtime, user-specific EEG data, Emotify displays a working proof of concept that aims at giving a wider user population autonomy over their music experience.
 - You can play and pause, go next or previous, or even cycle between playlists, all with the use of your brain.
    - The idea is to give full control of the main audio functionality over to EEG-trained brainwave commands in place of the usual physical inputs in order to provide accessibility to those who might benefit from an alternative methodoloy. It could also have implications on things like hands-free music control in the future.

- ðŸ“« If you're curious about myself or Emotify, drop me an email at jacoblarsendk@gmail.com or toss me a message on linkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobwlarsen/
- In any case, hope all is well :)
