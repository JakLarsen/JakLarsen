ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name's Jake, and I'm currently working on my Skydiving Coach license and building out my first demo app -Emotify-
- -Emotify- utilizes Neural-Navigation, allowing users to navigate a Spotify-inspired audio app using their BRAINWAVES.
  - Using an Emotiv Insight for realtime, user-specific EEG data, I've created a working app that, although only proof of concept (for now!), aims at giving a wider user population autonomy over their music experience.
  - You can play and pause, go next or previous, or even cycle between playlists, all with the use of your brain.
- ðŸ“« If you're curious about myself or Emotify, drop me an email at jacoblarsendk@gmail.com or toss me a message on linkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobwlarsen/
- In any case, hope all is well :)
